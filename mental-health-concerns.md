# Concerns about a staff member's mental health

## When to use

**If you're contacted by another organization for a reference about a former employee and you have concerns about their mental health**: This can be a challenging situation because you want to provide an honest assessment while also respecting the individual's privacy. Keep in mind that the potential employer deserves an honest assessment but remember to be respectful and cautious about revealing personal health information​.

**If you are actively managing an employee and notice signs of potential mental health struggles**: Mental health is a sensitive topic, but as a manager, you are often in a position where you may notice changes in an employee's behavior or performance that could suggest they are dealing with a mental health issue. These situations require a careful and empathetic approach6​.

## What to do

**Maintain confidentiality and respect their privacy**: When asked for a reference, remember that it's not your place to disclose someone's personal health information to others. Instead, focus on concrete, observable behaviors and performance in the workplace​​.

**Encourage them to seek professional help**: If you have a good relationship with the employee and feel it's appropriate, you might suggest that they speak to a mental health professional. You could also guide them towards resources provided by your organization, such as an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)​.

**Consult with HR or higher management**: If you have serious concerns about an employee's mental health—especially if it's impacting their work or they seem to be at risk—reach out to HR or a higher manager. They can guide you on the next steps and how to handle the situation, which may include reaching out to emergency contacts or directing the employee towards professional help​​.

Please note that while these guidelines provide general advice on handling these situations, they may not cover all possible scenarios or legal requirements. It's essential to familiarize yourself with your organization's policies on privacy and mental health, as well as the laws in your area, and to seek appropriate professional advice if needed.
