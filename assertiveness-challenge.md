# Navigating Assertiveness Challenges with Introverted or Conflict-Avoidant Employees

[Summarized from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/143gd30/has_anyone_successfully_made_an_employee_more/)

## When to Use
This playbook page should be used when a manager encounters an employee who is struggling with assertiveness, especially in environments where confrontation and argumentation may be necessary. This is particularly relevant for employees who are introverted or who tend to avoid conflict. The aim is to encourage the employee to stand up for themselves in a way that aligns with their natural disposition, rather than trying to fundamentally change their personality.

## What to Do

**Recognize and Respect Individuality**: Understand that some employees are naturally introverted or conflict-avoidant. Trying to fundamentally change their personality is not productive and may lead to unnecessary stress and failure. Instead, recognize their unique strengths and work to align their roles accordingly​.

**Empower Confidence in Expertise**: If an employee is knowledgeable in their field, emphasize that they should have confidence in their expertise. Encourage them to stand their ground when they know they are correct. Confidence can grow with time and experience​.

**Reflect on Successes**: Reflect on instances where the employee has succeeded and identify what factors contributed to their success. Use these insights to help guide them in future situations where assertiveness may be required​​.

**Offer Regular and Constructive Feedback**: Establish regular check-ins with the employee to discuss their performance, challenges, and progress. This not only helps them identify and leverage their strengths, but also shows that you are invested in their growth and development​​.

**Practice Scenarios**: If there are predictable situations where confrontation is likely, rehearse these scenarios in advance with the employee. Share "scripts" or suggestions for responses and encourage them to practice expressing these in their own words. This approach can help them feel more prepared and less under pressure during actual confrontations​​.

Remember, the goal is not to change the personality of the employee but to help them find their own voice and assertiveness in a way that is comfortable for them. It's important to be patient and give the employee space to grow and adapt at their own pace. If the situation doesn't improve, it may be necessary to reassess whether the role is a good fit for them.
