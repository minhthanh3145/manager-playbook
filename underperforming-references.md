# Handling Reference Requests for Underperforming Employees

## When to use
Use this guide when you receive a reference request from an underperforming or incompetent employee who is seeking a new job. This situation can be challenging as it requires balancing honesty about the employee's performance with the professional courtesy of providing a reference.

## What to do

**Consider the employee's performance and potential**: It's important to remember that an employee's performance can be influenced by their fit within the team or the specific role. A worker who struggles in one context might excel in another. Consider the employee's potential in a different role or environment when deciding how to handle their reference request​.

**Communicate honestly with the employee**: If you feel that you could not provide a positive reference, tell the employee honestly yet tactfully. You could say, "While I appreciate your request to use me as a reference, I ultimately do not feel that I would be the best person to do so"​1​. Alternatively, you could explain that you would have to be honest about their performance struggles if you were to provide a reference​.

**Understand the difference between a reference and employment verification**: A reference typically includes information about the employee's strengths, weaknesses, and job performance, while employment verification involves confirming job titles, dates of employment, and reasons for leaving, if it's not against company policy. If you're uncomfortable providing a reference, you can refuse when asked and instead offer to provide employment verification​.

**Check company policy**a Many companies have policies about providing references. Make sure you're familiar with your company's guidelines and adhere to them. If in doubt, consult with your HR department​.

**Be careful when giving a negative reference**: If you choose to give a reference that includes negative aspects of the employee's performance, be careful to only say things you're allowed to say. In some situations, you may only be permitted to say that the employee is "not eligible for rehire" without providing further details​.

**Keep the employee's morale in mind**: Even if the employee is underperforming, crushing their confidence won't benefit anyone. If they're looking for a new job, they likely already know that their current role isn't a good fit. Use your company's review process and feedback sessions to discuss performance gaps and deficiencies, rather than using the reference process for this purpose​.

**If necessary, keep things vague and positive**: If you find yourself in a position where you need to provide a reference but cannot say anything genuinely positive about the employee's work performance, you can mention positive aspects that are true, even if they're not directly related to the job. The person receiving the reference will likely understand the implication1​.

Remember, handling a reference request for an underperforming employee requires tact and discretion. Always strive to be professional, honest, and respectful in these situations.
